This script will allow your Windows PC to communicate with the Apple Remote V2 (A1294) Which is currently unsupported by Windows.
You will first need to install the EventGhost software.

Following this, import the AppleIR code that I have created into EventGhost and the remote should start functioning.

The script is optimised for Kodi but I have left the mappings in an easy to find area so that you can change it to your liking!
